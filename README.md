# HoundaCivic Portfolio Website

Static portfolio site built with plain HTML/CSS/JS. It hosts a landing page plus a handful of small demo pages and experiments.

## Pages
- `index.html`: main landing page with project links and featured work.
- `who-am-i.html`: bio, resume details, tech stack, and contact links.
- `cookie-clicker.html`: cookie clicker-style game with upgrades and save/load in local storage.
- `chat-bot.html`: Gemini API chat UI (client-side) with local key storage.
- `airplane-busywork.html`: "Airplane Busywork" mini page with simple JavaScript interactivity.

## Structure
- `Broderick_Pride_resume_2025.pdf`: downloadable resume PDF linked from the Who Am I page.
- `Styles/style.css`: shared styling, animations, and light/dark theme support.
- `IMG/`: images used across pages (profile image, pancake shark, etc.).

## How to Run
- Open `index.html` in a browser to start.
- No build step required.
- The chat bot page needs a Gemini API key and network access.

## Notes
- Links to external projects live on the landing page.
- This repo is a work-in-progress and evolves as new experiments are added.
